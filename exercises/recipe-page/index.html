        <h2 id="section1">Instructions</h2>
        <ul>
           <li>2 to 3 large potatoes (Russet or Yukon Gold)</li>
           <li>4 to 6 cups neutral oil (vegetable, canola, or avocado)</li>
           <li>salt, to taste</li>
           <li>black pepper (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b>Slice the Potatoes:</b> 
                Wash and peel the potatoes. Use a mandolin slicer to cut the 
                potatoes into thin slices, about 1/16 to 1/8-inch thick. For 
                regular chips, use the straight blade; for ruffle-style chips, 
                use the ridge-cut blade.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Soak the Slices:</b> 
                Place the potato slices in a bowl of ice water and soak for 
                20-30 minutes. This helps to remove excess starch, making the 
                chips crispier.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Rinse and Dry:</b> 
                Drain the potatoes and rinse under cold water until the water 
                runs clear. Pat each slice dry thoroughly with a clean kitchen 
                towel or paper towels. Ensuring the slices are dry is crucial 
                for crispy chips and prevents oil splatters.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Heat the Oil:</b> 
                In a deep pot or pan, heat the oil to 320°F. Maintaining this 
                temperature is key to achieving that light yellow color without
                over-browning.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Fry in Small Batches:</b> 
                Carefully add a small batch of potato slices to the oil, 
                ensuring not to overcrowd the pot. This helps keep the oil 
                temperature steady. After each batch, check the temperature 
                and let it return to 325-330°F if needed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Create the Folds:</b>
                As the chips begin to fry, gently stir and push them along 
                the edges of the pot with a slotted spoon to help form those 
                signature folds and curls before they crisp up.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Cook to Perfection:</b>
                Fry the chips for 3-5 minutes or until they are crisp and a 
                light yellow color. Remove them from the oil with a slotted 
                spoon and place them on a wire rack set over a baking sheet 
                to drain any excess oil.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Season and Serve:</b> 
                While the chips are still hot, sprinkle them with salt and a 
                pinch of black pepper, if desired. Enjoy them fresh, or store 
                in an airtight container once cooled.
            </li>

        <h2>Tips and Tricks</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Batch Frying:</b>
                    Always fry in small batches. This keeps the oil temperature
                    steady and prevents the chips from sticking together. After 
                    each batch, check your oil temperature and adjust as needed.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Oil Temperature:</b> 
                Use a thermometer to keep the oil around 320°F. Too hot, and 
                the chips will brown too quickly; too cool, and they’ll absorb 
                too much oil and become greasy.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <b>Storage:</b> 
                Once your chips are completely cooled, store them in an 
                airtight container to maintain their crispiness. They’ll keep 
                for a few days, but let’s be honest—they’re so good, they’ll 
                likely be gone before you know it!
