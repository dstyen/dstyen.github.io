                <p>
                    The Bible is a collection of religious texts that are 
                    central to Christianity and Judaism, and esteemed in other 
                    Abrahamic religions such as Islam. The Bible is an 
                    anthology (a compilation of texts of a variety of forms) 
                    originally written in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Koine Greek. 
                    The texts include instructions, stories, poetry, prophecies,
                    and other genres. The collection of materials accepted as 
                    part of the Bible by a particular religious tradition or 
                    community is called a biblical canon. Believers generally 
                    consider it to be a product of divine inspiration, but the 
                    way they understand what that means and interpret the text 
                    varies.

                <h4><a id=section3>Hebrew Bible</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The Bible is not a single book; it is a collection of books 
                    whose complex development is not completely understood. The 
                    oldest books began as songs and stories orally transmitted 
                    from generation to generation. Scholars of the twenty-first 
                    century are only in the beginning stages of exploring "the 
                    interface between writing, performance, memorization, and 
                    the aural dimension" of the texts. Current indications are 
                    that writing and orality were not separate as much as 
                    ancient writing was learned in communal oral performance. 
                    The Bible was written and compiled by many people, who many 
                    scholars say are mostly unknown, from a variety of 
                    disparate cultures and backgrounds.

                <h4><a id=section4>New Testament</a></h4>
                <p>
                    During the rise of Christianity in the first century CE, 
                    new scriptures were written in Koine Greek. Christians 
                    eventually called these new scriptures the "New Testament" 
                    and began referring to the Septuagint as the "Old 
                    Testament". The New Testament has been preserved in more 
                    manuscripts than any other ancient work. Most early 
                    Christian copyists were not trained scribes. Many copies 
                    of the gospels and Paul's letters were made by individual 
                    Christians over a relatively short period of time, very 
                    soon after the originals were written.[45] There is 
                    evidence in the Synoptic Gospels, in the writings of the 
                    early Church Fathers, from Marcion, and in the Didache 
                    that Christian documents were in circulation before the 
                    end of the first century. Paul's letters were circulated 
                    during his lifetime, and his death is thought to have 
                    occurred before 68 during Nero's reign. Early Christians 
                    transported these writings around the Empire, translating 
                    them into Old Syriac, Coptic, Ethiopic, and Latin, and 
                    other languages.

                <h2 id="heading"><a id=section5>Influence</a></h2>
                <p>
                    With a literary tradition spanning two millennia, the Bible 
                    is one of the most influential works ever written. From 
                    practices of personal hygiene to philosophy and ethics, 
                    the Bible has directly and indirectly influenced politics 
                    and law, war and peace, sexual morals, marriage and family 
                    life, letters and learning, the arts, economics, social 
                    justice, medical care and more.
                </p>
                <h4><a id=section6>Politics and Law</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The Bible has been used to support and oppose political 
                    power. It has inspired revolution and "a reversal of power" 
                    because God is so often portrayed as choosing what is "weak
                    and humble...(the stammering Moses, the infant Samuel, Saul 
                    from an insignificant family, David confronting Goliath, 
                    etc.)...to confound the mighty". Biblical texts have been 
                    the catalyst for political concepts like democracy, 
                    religious toleration and religious freedom. These have, in 
                    turn, inspired movements ranging from abolitionism in the 
                    18th and 19th century, to the civil rights movement, the 
                    Anti-Apartheid Movement, and liberation theology in Latin 
                    America. The Bible has been the source of many peace 
                    movements and efforts at reconciliation around the world.
                </p>
                <h4><a id="section7">Literature</a></h4>
                <p>
                    The Bible has directly and indirectly influenced 
                    literature: St Augustine's Confessions is widely considered 
                    the first autobiography in Western Literature. The Summa 
                    Theologica, written 1265â€“1274, is "one of the classics of 
                    the history of philosophy and one of the most influential 
                    works of Western literature."[208] These both influenced 
                    the writings of Dante's epic poetry and his Divine Comedy, 
                    and in turn, Dante's creation and sacramental theology has 
                    contributed to influencing writers such as J. R. R. Tolkien 
                    and William Shakespeare.
